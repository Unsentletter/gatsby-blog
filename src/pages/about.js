              As you can probably tell by the url that brought you here my name
              is Tristan Southwell. What you probably canâ€™t tell from that url
              is that I am a software developer, an aquarium enthusiast, an
              outdoors adventurer, and a fan of the oxford comma.
              <br />
              <br /> I created this blog as a fun way to share things I have
              learnt, and things I have achieved in my coding adventures, and in
              my aquarium adventures. It will also be fun for me to have a
              record of things I have learned and things I have achieved. It is
              always nice to look at your personal growth and feel good about
              yourself.

              The blogs are split into two categories. Tech Blog, and Fishroom.
              The titles are pretty self explanatory. Both blogs are a mixture
              of me writing down my thoughts, processes, and journeys, and posts
              where I will break a subject down and explain it. This will be as
              much for my own learning as well as anyone who happens upon this
              page. I love to learn and I love to teach, so this is me just
              living the dream.
